# Learn
A place to plan, create learning models for my tech trainings &amp; and talk about tech (or not)


Quite a number of persons showed interest in my tainings, this is good because i love teaching people to code.
The downside however is: i train for private organizations and can't merge new persons into the classes.

## My resolve is to create a new class that will be open to all; purpose of this class will be to:
1. Coach/mentor interested persons in Java
